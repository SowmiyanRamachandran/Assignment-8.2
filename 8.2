Explain the core changes made in Hadoop 2.x ?

When compared to hadoop 1.x ,many changes has been done especially on single point failure and decentralize JobTraker power to data nodes.
YARN stands for "Yet Another Source Negotiator".For efficient cluster utilization used in YARN.Its most powerful technology in hadoop 2.x.
Unlike 1.x,JobTraker,resource manager and job scheduling/monitoring done(Application Master)separate daemons.So ease the JobTraker problems.
Map reduce slots are changed from static to dynamic,job tracker bottleneck and node limitation (4000 to unlimited)has been rectified.
One of the another advantage is that it allows other application to integrate with HDFC.

Explain the difference between MapReduce 1 and MapReduce 2 / Yarn ?

In mapreduce 1,hadoop centralized all tasks to the JobTraker.It allocates resourses and scheduling the jobs across the cluster.In YARN,de-centralized
this to ease the work pressure on the JobTracker.Resource Manager responsibility allocate resources to the particular nodes and node manager schedule
the jobs on the application master.YARN allows parallel excecution and application manager managing and execute the job.This approach can ease many JobTraker
problems and improves to scale up ability and optimize the job performance.Additionally ,YARN can allows to create multiple applications to 
scale up on the distributed environment.
